    <p>Hello, I am from Kigali-Rwanda. I am 24 years of age, I am the 2nd born, I am single, 
        and I still live with my 6 <br> siblings and both of my parents too! We are a happy big family.
        We enjoy being together <br> during family time, and we are very grateful.</p>
    
    <p>In my daily life, I work as a farmer in tractor operation services. I do not know much About
        coding <br> and programming but I hope to know a lot through learning, with you, our instructor, <br> and
        using available resources.</p>
        
    <p>Un willingly I was not able to complete high school, so I am very grateful for the opportunity to gain higher education 
        online through BYU programms, <br> and very happy to meet and study with you guys.</p>
