      <h3>
        Rwanda's Gorilla Naming Ceremony
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">

        Get ready to experience one of the world's most important celebrations of nature and meet Rwanda's newborn baby gorillas.

        The Kwita Izina gorilla naming ceremony is modelled off a centuries-old tradition in which Rwandans name their
        children in the presence of family and friends. For three decades before the first official gorilla naming ceremony,
        park rangers and researchers named Rwanda's mountain gorilla babies to monitor each gorilla in their family and habitat. 

        In 2005, Rwanda began officially naming mountain gorillas in what has become a global celebration of nature. By giving a
        name to these majestic animals, they are given the value they undoubtedly deserve.
        
        The 19th Kwita Izina will be held on Friday, 1 September 2023, and will celebrate the country's commitment to sustainable 
        and responsible tourism.

        The ceremony is, first and foremost, an opportunity to thank the communities that live around the gorilla habitat, 
        Volcanoes National Park, research partners, vets and the dedicated conservationists, rangers and trackers who protect 
        the gorillas daily.

        Over the last fifteen years, more than 350 mountain gorillas have been named. Today, Kwita Izina forms part of an ambitious
        strategy to preserve Rwanda's natural heritage and further expand the role of tourism in the country's transformation.
        As a result of the naming ceremony, Rwandans from all walks of life understand the intrinsic value of gorillas and their
        contribution to the country's economic prosperity. Rwandans have become gorilla guardians.

        Overall, Rwanda has emerged as a conservation and sustainable tourism leader on the continent. For instance, while in 
        the 2010 Census, there were 480 mountain gorillas, the 2016 Census report indicated 604 individuals in the Virunga Massif.
        These efforts have contributed to the increase in mountain gorillas worldwide (1,063) and are categorised as no longer
        critically endangered.

      <h3>
        What to Wear
      </h3>

      <p>
        Dress codes are informal yet respectful. Men tend to wear trousers but shorts are fine, although walking around without
        a shirt is frowned upon. Women will feel more comfortable in knee-length or longer.

        Daytime temperatures are generally warm, so bring lots of light clothing and think about sun protection, including a
        hat and sunglasses. The evenings tend to be cool, and a light sweater appreciated.

        In Volcanoes National Park and Nyungwe National Park slightly heavier clothing is useful. A lightweight waterproof 
        jacket may come in handy in the moist mountains.

        Avoid wearing blue in Akagera National Park, which attracts tse tse flies, and take sensible precautions against 
        mosquitos and other bites.

        When tracking gorillas, wear sturdier clothing to protect against stinging nettles, and solid walking shoes. Consider
        bringing gardening or leather gloves as well as gaiters.

        For those who wear contact lenses, cleaning fluid is not readily available and dust or sun could prove an irritation, 
        so it's best to bring a pair of glasses along for peace of mind.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Gorilla Tracking
      </h3>

      <p>
        There are twelve gorilla families living in the Volcanoes National Park, which are fully habituated, with a few 
        others habituated solely for scientific research. The groups, or troops, consist of at least one silverback along with
        several females and youngsters.

        The troops are somewhat fluid in composition, but tend to stick to a preferred area. They are constantly monitored and 
        protected by park rangers, with each group coming into contact with tourists for a strict maximum of one hour per day.

        Eight tracking permits are issued per troop per day, meaning the encounter is as intimate and as unobtrusive as possible.
        With only 96 permits available each day in Rwanda, it is highly recommended to book in advance, either online or via a
        reputable tour operator.

        Visitors gather at the Volcanoes National Park headquarters in Kinigi at 7am, and are allocated a family group on the day
        according to fitness levels, as well as being briefed on protocols and rules for visiting the gorillas.

        The families are known as Susa, Igisha, Karisimbi, Sabyinyo, Amahoro, Agashya, Kwitonda, Umubano, Hirwa, Bwenge, Ugyenda 
        and Muhoza.

        Hikes up to their various locations can last anything from 30 minutes to four or more hours, reaching an altitude of 
        between 2,500m and 4,000m. Porters are available to carry backpacks and cameras, as well as to offer a helping hand along
        the route.

        10% of the revenue from the permits is channelled towards local communities, to build schools and health centres, as well 
        as roads. There is a compensation fund for local farmers should any gorillas damage their crops, which helps to ensure 
        peaceful co-existence.

        Gorilla tracking also provides employment for many locals, from rangers and trackers to porters, drivers and staff at 
        tourist lodges.

        For those interested in tracing the footsteps of Dian Fossey, her tomb is a 30-minute drive from the park headquarters
        and then two or three hours hike through the forest, to above 3,000m altitude.

        The annual Kwita Izina gorilla-naming ceremony is a special time to visit the Volcanoes National Park, with guided tours
        leading up the main event providing an opportunity to meet park staff and conservationists, attend cultural evenings and 
        a celebration in Musanze.

        At the naming ceremony itself, there's music, dancing, and discussion about Rwanda's great strides in gorilla conservation,
        and the great challenges that remain.

        Conservation organisations currently working in Rwanda include Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, The Gorilla 
        Organisation, International Gorilla Conservation Organisation, Gorilla Doctors and Wildlife Conservation Society.
