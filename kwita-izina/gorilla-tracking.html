            <p>
                There are twelve gorilla families living in the Volcanoes National Park, which are fully habituated, with a few 
                others habituated solely for scientific research. The groups, or troops, consist of at least one silverback along with
                several females and youngsters.
        
                The troops are somewhat fluid in composition, but tend to stick to a preferred area. They are constantly monitored and 
                protected by park rangers, with each group coming into contact with tourists for a strict maximum of one hour per day.
        
                Eight tracking permits are issued per troop per day, meaning the encounter is as intimate and as unobtrusive as possible.
                With only 96 permits available each day in Rwanda, it is highly recommended to book in advance, either online or via a
                reputable tour operator.

            <p>
                Visitors gather at the Volcanoes National Park headquarters in Kinigi at 7am, and are allocated a family group on the day
                according to fitness levels, as well as being briefed on protocols and rules for visiting the gorillas.
        
                The families are known as Susa, Igisha, Karisimbi, Sabyinyo, Amahoro, Agashya, Kwitonda, Umubano, Hirwa, Bwenge, Ugyenda 
                and Muhoza.
        
                Hikes up to their various locations can last anything from 30 minutes to four or more hours, reaching an altitude of 
                between 2,500m and 4,000m. Porters are available to carry backpacks and cameras, as well as to offer a helping hand along
                the route.
        
                10% of the revenue from the permits is channelled towards local communities, to build schools and health centres, as well 
                as roads. There is a compensation fund for local farmers should any gorillas damage their crops, which helps to ensure 
                peaceful co-existence.
        
                Gorilla tracking also provides employment for many locals, from rangers and trackers to porters, drivers and staff at 
                tourist lodges.
        
                For those interested in tracing the footsteps of Dian Fossey, her tomb is a 30-minute drive from the park headquarters
                and then two or three hours hike through the forest, to above 3,000m altitude.

                The annual Kwita Izina gorilla-naming ceremony is a special time to visit the Volcanoes National Park, with guided tours
                leading up the main event providing an opportunity to meet park staff and conservationists, attend cultural evenings and 
                a celebration in Musanze.
        
                At the naming ceremony itself, there's music, dancing, and discussion about Rwanda's great strides in gorilla conservation,
                and the great challenges that remain.
        
                Conservation organisations currently working in Rwanda include Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, The Gorilla 
                Organisation, International Gorilla Conservation Organisation, Gorilla Doctors and Wildlife Conservation Society.
