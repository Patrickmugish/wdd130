                <h2>Rwanda's Gorilla Naming Ceremony</h2>
                <p>
                    Get ready to experience one of the world's most important celebrations of nature and meet Rwanda's newborn baby gorillas.
            
                    The Kwita Izina gorilla naming ceremony is modelled off a centuries-old tradition in which Rwandans name their
                    children in the presence of family and friends. For three decades before the first official gorilla naming ceremony,
                    park rangers and researchers named Rwanda's mountain gorilla babies to monitor each gorilla in their family and habitat. 
            
                    In 2005, Rwanda began officially naming mountain gorillas in what has become a global celebration of nature. By giving a
                    name to these majestic animals, they are given the value they undoubtedly deserve.
                    
                    The 19th Kwita Izina will be held on Friday, 1 September 2023, and will celebrate the country's commitment to sustainable 
                    and responsible tourism.
            
                    The ceremony is, first and foremost, an opportunity to thank the communities that live around the gorilla habitat, 
                    Volcanoes National Park, research partners, vets and the dedicated conservationists, rangers and trackers who protect 
                    the gorillas daily.
            
                    Over the last fifteen years, more than 350 mountain gorillas have been named. Today, Kwita Izina forms part of an ambitious
                    strategy to preserve Rwanda's natural heritage and further expand the role of tourism in the country's transformation.
                    As a result of the naming ceremony, Rwandans from all walks of life understand the intrinsic value of gorillas and their
                    contribution to the country's economic prosperity. Rwandans have become gorilla guardians.
            
                    Overall, Rwanda has emerged as a conservation and sustainable tourism leader on the continent. For instance, while in 
                    the 2010 Census, there were 480 mountain gorillas, the 2016 Census report indicated 604 individuals in the Virunga Massif.
                    These efforts have contributed to the increase in mountain gorillas worldwide (1,063) and are categorised as no longer
                    critically endangered.

                <h2>What to Wear</h2>
                Dress codes are informal yet respectful. Men tend to wear trousers but shorts are fine, although walking around without
                a shirt is frowned upon. Women will feel more comfortable in knee-length or longer.
        
                Daytime temperatures are generally warm, so bring lots of light clothing and think about sun protection, including a
                hat and sunglasses. The evenings tend to be cool, and a light sweater appreciated.
        
                In Volcanoes National Park and Nyungwe National Park slightly heavier clothing is useful. A lightweight waterproof 
                jacket may come in handy in the moist mountains.
        
                Avoid wearing blue in Akagera National Park, which attracts tse tse flies, and take sensible precautions against 
                mosquitos and other bites.
        
                When tracking gorillas, wear sturdier clothing to protect against stinging nettles, and solid walking shoes. Consider
                bringing gardening or leather gloves as well as gaiters.
        
                For those who wear contact lenses, cleaning fluid is not readily available and dust or sun could prove an irritation, 
                so it's best to bring a pair of glasses along for peace of mind. <br>
